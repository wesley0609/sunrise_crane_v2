            "question": "Can I find a lifting company for moving?",
            "answer": "It is recommended to find a moving company for moving. However, if it is “valuable items”, “precision items”, “very heavy items”, “artifacts”, or if the moving space is too small to move smoothly, you can call a lifting company. The crane company usually specializes in moving semiconductor precision machinery and equipment, so they pay close attention to the details of the move and will make sure that the items are intact and moved precisely to the fixed point, but the price of the move will be higher than the traditional moving company."
